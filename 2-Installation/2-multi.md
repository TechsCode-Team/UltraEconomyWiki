## Network Installation

<br />

**Important:** Before installing, make sure bungeecord is set to true in EVERY spigot.yml

<br />

Firstly install the *UltraEconomy.jar* on every Server including your BungeeCord.
In the next step, you have to enable MySQL for every Server via the intuitive interface.

<br />

* Make sure that you have **ultraeconomy.admin** permision to get access to /uecon
* Execute **/uecon**, navigate to *Settings > MySQL* and enter your MySQL credentials 
* Restart your Server

After you have repeated that process for every Server, Ultra Economy should now be fully functional!
If Ultra Economy did not connect please follow the steps below.

<br />

#### Connecting the Bungee (Proxy)
* Navigate to the Ultra Economy folder of a connected server
* Enter the files *Registery.json* and copy the the MySQL key
**NOTE:** This key can continue on a second line!
* Navigate to the Ultra Economy folder on the bungee
* Open the *Registery.json* file and replace the key

The bungee should now been connected to your database.

<br />

In the event that you create a new Server, just repeat the steps. The BungeeCord is configuring itself fully automatically
